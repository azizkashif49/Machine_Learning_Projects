In this project I have trained 3 deep learning model on a dataset of Alzheimer MRI Imgages which was a multiclass classification.
For the first model I have used a CNN Architecture
For the second training I have used a pre-trained VGG-19 model and fine tuned it for my own problem
For the third training I have used a ANN model which I have build from scratch

For the CNN and Pretrained I have got good results but for the ANN one I wasn't able to get good results because the data set was very Imbalance although I have used different techniques to remove this problem but the results for ANN were not the one I was hoping for.
